This is uDump 1.03, a simple TOS ROM dump tool for Atari ST/STE/TT/Falcon
computers. I made it because there isn't one single realiable tool of this kind
running on all Atari models, resp. dumping properly all the possible TOS sizes.

While it's pretty simple, it's possible there is a bug or two.

The tool is licensed under the GPL v3 license, see COPYING.txt for details.

Enjoy,
